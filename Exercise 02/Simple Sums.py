# Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks

# In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
# metic operations, and print the result to the console.

# Steps:
# 1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
# 2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
# 3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
# 4. Print the value of the sum to the console.

# sum of 2 numbers through variables

number_1 = 8 # first variable storing the integer 8
number_2 = 10 # second variable storing the integer 10
number_3 = number_1 + number_2 # third variable that stores the sum of the first two variables

print(number_3) # print statement that prints the third variable
