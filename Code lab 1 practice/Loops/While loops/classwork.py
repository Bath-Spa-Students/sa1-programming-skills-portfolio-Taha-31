# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# Print j as long as j is less than 10:

i = 1
while i < 10:
  print(i)
  i += 1  # i =i+1  


  count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

    #Infinite Loop With Break Statement 

j = 1
while j < 6:
  print(j)
  if j == 3:
    break
  j += 1   # j=j+1  Both are same
