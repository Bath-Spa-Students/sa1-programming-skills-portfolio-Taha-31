# type casting

x = str(9) # this will make the integer value 9, into a string so itll be "9"
y = int(0) #this wont change anything since 0 is already an integer
z = float(5) # itll show the value in the brackets as a floating point, so itll add a decimal place

print(x,y,z)
print(type(x)) #this will show the type of x, which is str as specified in my code

a = 4
A = "Sally"
# A will not overwrite a 
print(A, a) #the two a values are different so two different things are going to be printer :3

print("my name is {a}") # this will NOT show the assigned expression of the variable A because f string is missing
